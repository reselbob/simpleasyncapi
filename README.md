# Autogenerate a MQTT broker for the Wise Sayings async API

## Run this code in a Katacoda Ubuntu playground

**Step 1:** Go to

`https://katacoda.com/courses/ubuntu/playground`

**Step 2:** Clone the respository code:

`git clone https://github.com/reselbob/simpleasyncapi.git`

**Step 3:** Navigate to the working directory of the `gen` folder

`cd simpleasyncapi/gen`

**Step 4:** Add the Node.js packages

`npm install`

**Step 5:**  Run the code

`node index.js`

**Step 6:** Navigate to the generated `output` directory

`cd ../output`

**Step 7:** Add the Node.js packages

`npm install`

**Step 8:** Start up Mosquitto

`npm start`

You'll get output as follows:

```
 SUB  Subscribed to wisesaying
 PUB  Will eventually publish to wisesaying
Wise Sayings API 1.0.0 is ready! 

ðŸ”—  MQTT adapter is connected!

```

# Install the MQTT command line tool

`npm install mqtt -g`

# Run the Subscriber to the Wise Sayings async API.

`mqtt sub -t 'hello' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -v`

# Run the producer to the Wise Sayings async API.

`mqtt pub -t 'hello' -h 'test.mosquitto.org' -m 'from MQTT.js'`
